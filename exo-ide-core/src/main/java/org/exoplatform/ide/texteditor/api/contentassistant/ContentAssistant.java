/**
 * An <code>ContentAssistant</code> provides support on interactive content completion.
 * The content assistant is a {@link Editor} add-on. Its
 * purpose is to propose, display, and insert completions of the content
 * of the text viewer's document at the viewer's cursor position. In addition
 * to handle completions, a content assistant can also be requested to provide
 * context information. Context information is shown in a tool tip like popup.
 * As it is not always possible to determine the exact context at a given
 * document offset, a content assistant displays the possible contexts and requests
 * the user to choose the one whose information should be displayed.
 * <p>
 * A content assistant has a list of {@link ContentAssistProcessor}
 * objects each of which is registered for a  particular document content
 * type. The content assistant uses the processors to react on the request
 * of completing documents or presenting context information.
