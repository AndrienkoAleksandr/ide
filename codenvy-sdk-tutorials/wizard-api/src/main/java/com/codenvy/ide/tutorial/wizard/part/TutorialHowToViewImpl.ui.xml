            This is a Wizard API How-to.Â You can see a
            <strong>Wizard</strong>
            menu above the toolbar with Simple Wizard.

            In this tutorials we can:
            <ul>
                <li>insert either Page 2 or Page 3 after Page 1 (a user makes a choice on Page 1)</li>
                <li>choose if or not to show Page 4 after Page 2 or Page 3</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>When Page 2 is chosen, Page 3 is non-existent (there is no such task) and vice versa (same principle works when Page 3
                    is chosen)
                </li>
                <li>When page 4 is not chosen, the page still exists but it is just not displayed. A typical example, if there is just one
                    template in Page 4 and we do not need to display it as a user's choice is obvious.
                </li>
            </ul>
            Take a look at the chart explaining Tutorial Wizard logic:
