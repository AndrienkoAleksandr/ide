 * The interface of a document content formatter. The formatter formats ranges

 * The content formatter is assumed to determine the partitioning of the document
 * range to be formatted. For each partition, the formatter determines based
 * on the partition's content type the formatting strategy to be used. Before
 * the first strategy is activated all strategies are informed about the
 * start of the formatting process. After that, the formatting strategies are
 * activated in the sequence defined by the partitioning of the document range to be
 * formatted. It is assumed that a strategy must be finished before the next strategy
 * can be activated. After the last strategy has been finished, all strategies are
 * informed about the termination of the formatting process.</p>
