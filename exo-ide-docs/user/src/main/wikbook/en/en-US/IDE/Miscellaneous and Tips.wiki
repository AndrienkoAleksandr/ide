h1. Customize Hotkeys

The hotkey manager enables you to customize hotkeys applied for eXo IDE. If your customized hotkeys are matching with browser hotkeys, only eXo IDE hotkeys will work out.

To customize your own hotkeys, do as follows:

* *Step 2:* Click on the action in the *Customize hotkeys* dialog.
* *Step 3:* Enter the hotkeys combination in the *Hotkey* field. The first key should be "Ctrl" or "Alt".
If the hotkeys combination is not already assigned to another command, the *Bind* button will be active. Otherwise, the error message is shown under the *Hotkey* field. For example:
