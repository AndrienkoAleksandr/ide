When the application is launched the first thing you see is the window like this:

The _Virtual File System_ is the physical location (file path) you are working in. It is displayed as the _Workspace Panel_ containing folders and files.


The _Content Panel_ consists of two horizontal panels:

* The _Top Panel_ shows files in several file tabs with their content.
* The _Bottom Operation Panel_ may contain several tabs with the list of file properties, REST Service, Google Gadget or Netvibes Widget output messages, HTML, Google Gadget, ECM Template or Netvibes Widget files preview. To view these tabs, just use special buttons at the right part of the toolbar, or select *View* or *Run* from the top menu.

These panels are divided by _Horizontal Resize Bar_. Both _Workspace Panel_ and _Content Panel_ are also divided by the _Vertical Resize Bar_.
You can maximize or minimize one of the panels by clicking the special button at the top right corner of this panel.

You can do some basic actions, such as browsing, creating, editing, copying, renaming, uploading, downloading, moving, deleting files and folders. At the right column are shown the _Outline Panel_ and _Version Panel_:

* The _Outline Panel_ enables you to access tags, variables, functions and other file elements quickly.

* The _Version Panel_ is to navigate to the file versions.

* The active panel is highlighted with one special thick border around the panel window.
