When you access the eXo IDE, a window will appear:

*Illustration 2. The eXo IDE interface with main parts*

The IDE gadget operates with so-called _Virtual File System_ which provides known folders/files model. At a given time, the IDE user can operate with VFS, which is represented as a _Workspace_. The current _Workspace_ is displayed in the _Workspace Panel_ in the left panel as a tree of folders and files. The _Outline Panel_ is to do quick access to variables and functions (only for JavaScript, HTML, XML and Gadget files). The _Content Panel_ consists of two horizontal panels:
* The _Top Panel_ shows files in several file tabs with content.
* The _Bottom Panel_ may contain several tabs with the list of file properties, REST Service, or Google Gadget output messages, HTML or Gadget files preview. To view these tabs, just use special buttons at the right part of the _Toolbar_, or select *View* or *Run* from the top menu.
These panels are divided by _Horizontal Resize Bar_. Also, _Workspace Panel_ and _Content Panel_ are divided by _Vertical Resize Bar_.
You can maximize or minimize one of the file tabs or action tabs from the bottom part of _Content Panel_ or _Outline Panel_ by clicking the special button at the top right corner of the panel.
You can do some basic actions, such as browsing, creating, editing, coping, renaming, uploading, downloading, moving, deleting files and folders.

h1. Open Folder

There are two ways to open a folder from the _Workspace Panel_:
* *The first way:* Click the plus icon at the left of the folder name.
* *The second way:* Double-click the folder item in the _Workspace Panel_.

The path to the current folder is displayed under the _Workspace Panel_ in the _Status Bar_.

h1. Open File

To open a file in the _Content Panel_, double-click the file item in the _Workspace Panel_. The eXo IDE saves the history of opened files in browser cookies, so you can see all the file tabs created and opened even after refreshing the browser window.

h1. Refresh Browser

To refresh the selected folder content in the _Workspace Panel_, click the *Refresh Selected Folder* button on the _Toolbar_, or go to *File > Refresh*.

h1. Obtain and Copy File's URL to Clipboard 

To view and copy some absolute URLs of file/folder to clipboard, do as follows:
* *Step 1:* Select the appropriate item in the _Workspace Panel_.
* *Step 2:* Go to *View > Get URL...* from the top menu.  
The *Item's URL* dialog will be displayed that enables you to copy the target URL to the clipboard.

h1. Copy / Cut / Paste Folders and Files

You can copy, cut, or paste an item by selecting corresponding icons from the _Toolbar_, or select *Edit* on the top menu. 
Only after you have selected to copy or cut the item, the *Paste* function will be enabled. You will be able to paste selected files or folders from one folder to another using the *Paste* function:

The eXo IDE does not support "Copy" and "Cut" functions for folders and/or files placed in the different folders; so if any items selected on different levels, those functions will be disabled.
