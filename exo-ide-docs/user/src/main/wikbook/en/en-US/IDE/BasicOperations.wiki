IDE gadget operates with so called Virtual File System which provides known folders / files model. At a given time an IDE user can operate with some one representation of VFS, which is represented as a _Workspace_. Current Workspace is displayed in _Workspace Panel_ which is displayed in the left side panel as a tree of folders and files. _Outline Panel_ for quick access to variables and functions (only for JavaScript, HTML, XML and Gadget files), and _Content Panel_, which consists of two horizontal panels:
* _Top Panel_ represents files in several file tabs with content;
* _Bottom Panel_ may contain several tabs with list of file properties, REST Service or Google Gadget output messages, HTML or Gadget files preview. To view this tabs, just use special buttons at the right part of the _Toolbar_ or select *View* or *Run* from the top menu.
These panels are divided by _Horizontal Resize Bar_. Also _Workspace Panel_ and _Content Panel_ are divided by _Vertical Resize Bar_.
You can maximize or minimize one of the file tabs or action tabs from bottom part of _Content Panel_ or _Outline Panel_ by clicking on the special button at the top right corner of the panel.
