h1. Customize Hotkeys

The hotkey manager enables you to customize hotkeys applied for eXo IDE. If your customized hotkeys are matching with browser hotkeys, only eXo IDE hotkeys will work out.

If hotkeys of the browser and of eXo IDE are not overridden, they will work as usual.

To customize your own hotkeys, do as follows:

* *Step 1:* Go to *Window > Customize Hotkeys...* on the top menu to open the *Customize hotkeys* dialog.

*Illustration. Customize hotkeys*

The *Customize hotkeys* dialog consists of the list grid with all commands divided to groups and their hotkeys.

* *Step 2:* Click your desired action in the *Customize hotkeys* dialog.
* *Step 3:* Enter the hotkeys combination in the *Hotkey* field. The first key should be "Ctrl" or "Alt".
If the hotkeys combination is not already assigned to another command, the *Bind* button will be active. Otherwise, the error message is shown under the *Hotkey* field. For example:

!customize-hotkeys-error.png!

*Illustration. Error message*

* *Step 4:* Click the *Bind* button.
* *Step 5:* Click *Save* to accept your new settings on the server.


To unbind hotkeys for one command, do as follows:

* *Step 1:* Open the *Customize hotkeys* window.
* *Step 2:* Select your needed command in the list grid.
* *Step 3:* Click *Unbind*.
* *Step 4:* Click *Save* to accept your new settings on the server.

{note}
* You can not make any changes for hotkeys of the "Editor hotkeys" group, because they are reserved and used in editors. These hotkeys also can not be reapplied for other commands. To see these hotkeys, scroll down the end of the "Customize hotkeys" window and click the plus icon next to "Editor hotkeys".

* If you still want to bind the hotkeys which are the same as the predefined hotkeys, except those of the "Editor hotkeys" group, first select and unbind the predefined hotkeys.
