Codenvy serves two types of J2EE roles: *administrators* and *developers*. Before working with the Codenvy, make sure (ask your system admin) that your credentials contain one of the listed roles. Codenvy offers pretty the same functionality for them except that *developers* can not deploy theirs REST services on common environment and uses kind of "sandbox" to deploy them.
