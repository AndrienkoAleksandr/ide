The zip-archive with folder content is prepared on the server and sent to the client. There will be a suggestion window for you to save the archive on your local computer.

{note}
The archive uses UTF-8 encoding in entry names. Be sure that your zip extractor supports UTF-8 in file names. The Windows Explorer does not support it, you may use 7zip to unzip the archive. In Linux, the unzip (6.0 or below) command also does not support UTF-8 (depending on distributive). If you use KDE 4 as DE, you may configure Dolphin to use archive as folder by going to "Settings > Configure Dolphin.. > Navigation", and then selecting the "Open archive as folder" checkbox.
