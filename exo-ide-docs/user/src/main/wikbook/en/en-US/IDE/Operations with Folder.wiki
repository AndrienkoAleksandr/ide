h1. Create Folder

To create a folder, do as follows:
* *Step 1:* Find and select the target folder.
* *Step 2:* Click the *New* button on the _Toolbar_, then select *Folder...* from the drop-down menu; or go to *File > New > Folder...* from the top menu.
* *Step 3:* Type the new folder name in the *Create folder* form.
* *Step 4:* Click *Create* if you accept the new folder, or *Cancel* to discard without creating the new folder.

If a file is selected in the _Workspace Panel_, there will be a folder created in the parent folder of this file. If a folder is selected, there will be a folder created under this folder.
In case of no selected item in the _Workspace Panel_, the folder will be created in the root folder.
In case of multiple selections, the command to create folders will be disabled.

h1. Delete Folder

To delete a folder, do as follows:
* *Step 1:* Select the folder item in the _Workspace Panel_.
* *Step 2:* Click the *Delete Item(s)...* icon on the _Toolbar_, or go to *File > Delete...* from the top menu.
* *Step 3:* Confirm the deletion in the *Delete Item(s)* dialog.
Files opened in the _Content Panel_ will be closed after the folder containing them has been removed.

{note}
You cannot remove:
* workspace root folder;
* multiple items from different hierarchic levels at the same time.

So, the "Delete Item(s)" button will be disabled if the root item is selected, or there are multiple selections on different levels in the "Workspace Panel".

h1. Rename Folder

To rename a folder, do as follows:
* *Step 1:* Select the folder you want to rename in the _Workspace Panel_.

h1. Download Zipped Folder

If you want to download some folders from the _JCR Repository_, do as follows:
* *Step 1:* Select the target folder.
* *Step 2:* Go to *File > Download Zipped Folder...* from the top menu.
The zip-archive with folder content will be prepared on the server and sent to the client. So, the browser will suggest you save the archive on the local computer.


{note}
The archive uses UTF-8 encoding in entry names. Be sure that your zip extractor supports UTF-8 in file names. The Windows Explorer does not support it, you may use 7zip to unzip the archive. In Linux, the unzip (6.0 and older) command also does not support UTF-8 (depending on distributive). If you use KDE 4 as DE, you may configure Dolphin to use archive as folder (in Dolphin, go to "Settings > Configure Dolphin.. > Navigation", then select the "Open archive as folder" checkbox).
