Google Gadget file is the XML-file with special MIME type "application/x-google-gadget". With eXo IDE you can create such file, edit with Code or WYSIWYG Editor, preview\_ in _Preview Tab_ of eXo IDE, deploy/undeploy it on the server through shindig-library, add deployed gadget to some page in portal.

h1. Create Google Gadget

There are three ways to create Google Gadget within the eXo IDE:
# Click on *"New->Google Gadget"* _Toolbar_ button or use *"File->New->Google Gadget"* top menu command.
# Open existed gadget from local system by selecting *"File->Open Local File"* from top menu.
# Upload existed gadget directly to JCR by selecting *"File->Upload"* from top menu.

In 2^nd^ and 3^rd^ case, don't forget to select MIME type _"application/x-google-gadget"_.

h1. Deploy/Undeploy gadget in portal

To deploy some Google Gadget to portal, do as follows:
# Save file before deploying.
# Open file in the _Content Panel_.
# Click on *"Deploy Gadget to Portal"* button of _Toolbar_ or select *"Run->Deploy Gadget to Portal"* from top menu.

After that the deploy request will be sent to the server, and if there are no errors - the message like the following will be displayed in the _Output Tab_:

{screen}
\[INFO\]/rest/private/ide/gadget/deploy?gadgetURL=http%3A%2F%2F192.168.0.130%3A8080%2Frest%2Fprivate%2
Fjcr%2Frepository%2Fdev-monit%2FTest+Gadget+File.xml&privateContext=%2Frest%2Fprivate&publicContext=
%2Frest deployed successfully.
 {screen}

It means that gadget was deployed to the portal with title set in the gadget's '<ModulePrefs title="Hello World\!" />', e.g.:

Otherwise, error message will be displayed in the _Output Tab_.

Calling the *"Undeploy"* operation is similar to the *"Deploy"* - you have to:
# Find deployed earlier service in the _Workspace_ and open this one in the _Content Panel_.
# Click on *"Undeploy Gadget from Portal"* button of _Toolbar_ or call *"Run->Undeploy"* top menu command, and verify if there is no error message in the _Output Tab_.

If everything is fine, then you will get message like that:
{screen}
\[INFO\]/rest/private/ide/gadget/undeploy?gadgetURL=http%3A%2F%2F192.168.0.130%3A8080%2Frest%2Fprivate
%2Fjcr%2Frepository%2Fdev-monit%2FTest+Gadget+File.xml&privateContext=%2Frest%2Fprivate&publicContext=
%2Frest undeployed successfully.
 {screen}

h1. Preview gadget

To preview gadget you may open saved earlier gadget file and click on *"Show Preview"* button on _Toolbar_ or select *"Run->Show Preview"* top menu command. Then gadget will be opened in the _Gadget Container_ of _Preview Tab_, as it is figured at the picture *"Google Gadget Operations"* above.
