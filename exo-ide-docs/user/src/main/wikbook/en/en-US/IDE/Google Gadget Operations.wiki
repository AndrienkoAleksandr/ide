Google Gadget file - it is the xml-file with special mime type "application/x-google-gadget". With eXo _IDE_ you can _create_ such file, _edit with Code or WYSIWYG Editor_, _preview_ in _Preview Tab_ of eXo _IDE_, _deploy/undeploy_ it on the server through shindig-library, _add deployed gadget_ to the some page on portal.

h2. Create Google Gadget

There are three ways to create Google Gadget within the eXo _IDE_:

# Click on *"New->Googel Gadget"* toolbar button or use *"File->New->Google Gadget"* top menu command.
# Open existed gadget from local system by using *"File->Open Local File"* topmenu command.
# Upload existed gadget directly to JCR by using *"File->Upload"* top menu command.

In 2 and 3 cases, please, don't forget select mime type _"application/x-google-gadget"_.

h2. Deploy/UnDeploy gadget to GateIn

To deploy some Google Gadget to GateIn, please:

# Save file before deploying.
# Open file in the _Content Panel_
# Click on *"Deploy Gadget to GateIn"* button of toolbar or call *"Run->Deploy Gadget to GateIn"* top menu command.

After that the deploy request will be sent to the server, and if there are no errors - the message like next will be displayed in the _Output Tab_:
{noformat}
[INFO] /rest/private/ide/gadget/deploy?gadgetURL=http%3A%2F%2F192.168.0.130%3A8080%2Frest%2Fprivate%2Fjcr%2Frepository%2Fdev-monit%2FTest+Gadget+File.xml&privateContext=%2Frest%2Fprivate&publicContext=%2Frest deployed successfully
{noformat}

It means, that gadget had deployed into the GateIn with title set in the gadget's '<ModulePrefs title="Hello World\!" />', e.g.:

Otherwise, in the _Output Tab_ will be displayed error message.

Calling the *"UnDeploy"* operation is similar to the *"Deploy"* \- you should:

# Find out deployed earlier service in the _Workspace_ and open this one in the _Content Panel_.
# Click on *"Undeploy Gadget from GateIn"* button of toolbar or call *"Run->Undeploy"* top menu command, and verify if there is no error message in the _Output Tab_.

If everything Ok, then you will get message like that:
{noformat}
[INFO] /rest/private/ide/gadget/undeploy?gadgetURL=http%3A%2F%2F192.168.0.130%3A8080%2Frest%2Fprivate%2Fjcr%2Frepository%2Fdev-monit%2FTest+Gadget+File.xml&privateContext=%2Frest%2Fprivate&publicContext=%2Frest undeployed successfully.
{noformat}

h2. Preview gadget

To preview gadget you should open saved earlier gadget file and click on *"Show Preview"* button of toolbar or call *"Run->Show Preview"* top menu command. Then gadget will be opened in the _Gadget Container_ of _Preview Tab_, as it is figured out at the picture *"Google Gadget Operations"* above.
