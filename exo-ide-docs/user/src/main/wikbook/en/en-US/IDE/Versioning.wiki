The eXo IDE realization of _Versioning_ gives user an opportunity to work with the version history of the file: 
* view version's content;
* view the list of versions;
* restore to the concrete version. 
A new version of the file is being created each time after the saving of file content, that is after the clicking the *Save* button. There are no versions in version history just after the file had been created only.

h1. View Version History

To view the version history of the active file (that is file opened in editor and selected), click the *View Item Version History* button at the right part of the toolbar; or select *View > Version History...* on the topmenu. _Version Panel_ with latest version content will be opened at the right column of IDE window:

The version name is displayed in the title of the _Version Panel_.

{note}
If opened file is not versioned yet (that is just created), the "View Version History" button and top menu item will be disabled.

{note}
eXo IDE opens file version in read only mode. So, you can not edit it.

{note}
After you had opened or selected another file in editor, the "Version Panel" of the previous file is closed.
