Versioning, that is represented in IDE, gives an opportunity to work with the version history of the document: view the list of file's versions and their content in editor and restore the concrete version. A new version of the file is created each time, when content is saved ("Save" button). There are no versions in version history just after the file had been created.

h1. View Version History

To view the version history of the active file (opened in editor and selected), do as follows:
* *Step 1:* Go to *File > Version History...* on top menu
* *Step 2:* View the list of versions with the latest one on top as below:

h1. Open Version's Content

To open file's version in editor, do as follows:
* *Step 1:* Go to *File > Version History..." on top menu to open file's version history.
* *Step 2:* Select the version in the list and double-click the selected item, or click the *Open* button.
   The editor's tab with version has the title, which consists of the file's (version owner) name and the version's display name in braï¿½kets.

{note}
Opened version in editor is in read only mode, so you can not edit and save this version.
{note}

When version is opened in editor, it is possible to view the older or newer version relatively active one, just clicking *"View Older Version"* (*"View->Older Version"* in top menu) or *"View Newer Version"* (*"View->Newer Version"* in top menu) accordingly(pic. 30). In this case tab with opened version will display another one : older or newer (depends on your choice). When there is no newer version, than corresponding command is disabled, the same thing when there is no older version.
