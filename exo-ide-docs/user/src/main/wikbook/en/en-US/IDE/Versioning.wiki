eXo IDE provides the versioning that enables you to realize the versions history of the file: 

* view version's content;
* view the list of versions;
* restore to an accurate version. 
A new version of the file is created each time after the file content has been saved by clicking the *Save* button. There are no versions in version history just after the file had been created only.

h1. View Version History

To view the version history of the file which is being opened/selected, click the *View Item Version History* button at the right part of the toolbar; or select *View > Version History...* on the top menu. The _Version Panel_ with content of the latest version are opened at the right column of the eXo IDE window:

*Illustration. View version history of the active file*

The version name is displayed in the title of the _Version Panel_.

{note}
* If the selected/opened file is not versioned yet, the "View Version History" function will be disabled.

* The file version is opened in the read-only mode. So, you can not edit it.

* If any files are opened, the "Version Panel" of the previously opened file will be closed automatically.

h1. Version Navigation

With eXo IDE, you can navigate to any older or newer versions of the opened file.
