Outline tree refreshes automatically after 2 seconds from stop typing code. You can click on the item in outline tree, then cursor will set on the line, where this item is defined. When you move cursor on the page, current token is selected in outline tree.

h1. Edit File in WYSIWYG Editor

Instead of _Code Editor_ you can open and edit HTML files and _Google Gadgets_ within the _WYSIWYG Editor_ based on CKEditor. Even more, it is possible to set _WYSIWYG Editor_ for those files as default.
_WYSIWYG Editor_ is eXo GWT implementation of CKEditor application from [http://ckeditor.com/|http://ckeditor.com/] \- the widely used WYSIWYG-editor of HTML-content. Also it is used to edit Google Gadget files.

_WYSIWYG Editor_ doesn't support line numbering, auto indentation and format, code coloring, autocomplete, code outline. Instead of these, you will have powerful editor, which means that the text edited in it looks as similar as possible to the results, that users have when publishing it. It brings to the web common editing features found on desktop editing applications like Microsoft Word and OpenOffice.
How to open file in WYSIWYG Editor is explained in the point *"Open file with non-default editor"* above.

[This User Guide|http://docs.cksource.com/FCKeditor_2.x/Users_Guide ] is a good start point to get advanced information about this editor.

h1. Preview File Properties

Connected with JCR repository node, file properties are displayed in the special _Properties Tab_ in bottom part of _Content Panel_. To view file properties:
# Open this file in the _Content Panel_.
# Click on *"Show Properties"* button at the right part of the _Toolbar_ or call the *"View->Properties"* top menu command.
