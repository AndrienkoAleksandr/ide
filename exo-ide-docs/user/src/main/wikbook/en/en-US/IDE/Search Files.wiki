Codenvy enables you to search by file content and MIME type. To find, do as follows:
* *Step 1:* Select the target folder or root folder in the _Workspace Panel_ or in the _Project Explorer_.
* *Step 2:* Click the *Search...* icon on the toolbar; or go to *File > Search...* on the top menu to open the *Search* dialog.
* *Step 3:* Set parameters for two criteria fields, including *Containing text* and *MIME type*. If those fields are empty, all files in the search results will be displayed.
* *Step 4:* Click *Search*.
The found results are displayed in the _Search Panel_ on the left part of the application:

*Illustration. Search files*

Within the _Search Panel_, you can only open found files, edit, save, save as template, or perform some specific operations, such as deploying for services, and going to the parent folder in the _Project Explorer_.

If you maximize the _Editor Panel_, _Properties, Output_, _Outline_ or other panels, the default perspective will be restored to show the _Search Tab_ when you receive search results.
