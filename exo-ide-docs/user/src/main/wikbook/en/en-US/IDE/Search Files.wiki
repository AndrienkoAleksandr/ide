eXo _IDE_ proposes file search on file content and mime-type. Taking into account that file search in repository is based on [Lucene|#JCR.FulltextSearchAndSettings] and depends on _Mime type_ of files. To found out some file(s) you could:

# Select target folder or root folder in the _Workspace Panel_.
# Click on *"Search..."* button or call *"File->Search..."* top menu command to open *"Search"* dialog.
# Set search request parameters: containing text in the *"Contaning text"* field and mime-type in the *"Mime type"* field. If those fields are empty, then gadget will display all files in the search results.
# Press the *"Search"* button.

Then search results will be displayed in tree view in _Search Panel_ at the left column of gadget:

*Picture 24. Search files*

Within _Search Panel_ you will able only _open_ found file, _edit_, _save_ it as is or as template, _perform type specific operations_ like deploy for services, and _go to parent folder_ in _Workspace Panel_.

If you have maximized _Editor Panel_, _Properties, Output_ or _Outline Panel_, when you receive search results, default perspective will be restored to show _Search Tab_.
