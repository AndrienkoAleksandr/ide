eXo IDE proposes search by file content and MIME type. Taking into consideration that file search in repository is based on _[Lucene|http://wiki.exoplatform.org/xwiki/bin/view/JCR/Fulltext+Search]_ and depends on _MIME type_ of files. To find some file(s) do as follows:
# Select target folder or root folder in the _Workspace Panel_.
# Click on *"Search..."* button or select *"File->Search..."* from top menu to open *"Search"* dialog.
# Set search request parameters: containing text in the *"Containing text"* field and MIME type in the *"MIME type"* field. If those fields are empty, then gadget will display all files in the search results.
# Press the *"Search"* button.

Then the search results will be displayed in _Search Panel_ on the left of the gadget:

Within _Search Panel_ you are only able to open found file(s), edit, save or save as template, perform specific type of operations like deploy for services, and go to parent folder in _Workspace Panel_.

If you have maximized _Editor Panel_, _Properties, Output_ or _Outline Panel_, default perspective will be restored to show the _Search Tab_  when you receive search results,
