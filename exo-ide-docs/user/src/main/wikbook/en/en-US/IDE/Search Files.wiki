The eXo IDE enables users to search by file content and MIME type. Taking into consideration that the file search in repository is based on _[Lucene|http://wiki.exoplatform.org/xwiki/bin/view/JCR/Fulltext+Search]_ and depends on _MIME type_ of files. To find some files, do as follows:
* *Step 1:* Select the target folder or root folder in the _Workspace Panel_.
* *Step 2:* Click the *Search...* icon on the _Toolbar_; or go to *File > Search...* on the top menu to open the *Search* dialog.
* *Step 3:* Set parameters for two criteria fields, including *Containing text* and *MIME type*. If those fields are empty, the gadget will display all files in the search results.
* *Step 4:* Click *Search*.
The found results will be displayed in the _Search Panel_ on the left of gadget:

Within the _Search Panel_, you can only open found files, edit, save, save as template, or perform some specific operations like deploying for services, and going to the parent folder in the _Workspace Panel_.

If you have maximized the _Editor Panel_, _Properties, Output_, or _Outline Panel_, default perspective will be restored to show the _Search Tab_ when you receive search results.
