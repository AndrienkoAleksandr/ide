The _Netvibes widget_ uses Universal Widget API (UWA) - a powerful framework for Web widgets development - for both Netvibes widgets and many various environments.

The UWA widget consists of combinations from XHTML/XML, JavaScript/Ajax, CSS code with the MIME type *application/x-uwa-widget*.
In eXo IDE, you can create the Netvibes widget, preview it and deploy to [Netvibes Ecosystem|http://eco.netvibes.com].
